== What is Category Theory?
Consider the following mathematical objects:
- Sets
- Groups
- Rings
- Topological spaces
Hopefully, if you're in this class, you've heard of at least one of these mathematical objects. If you're familiar with multiple, then you may have noticed some similarities between them:
- The objects are generally sets with extra structure.
- There are "special functions" between two objects which preserve the structure of the objects:
  - Sets: functions
  - Groups: group homomorphisms
  - Rings: ring homomorphisms
  - Vector spaces: linear map
  - Topological spaces: continuous functions
- There is some notion of "equality" between pairs of objects:
  - Sets: bijections
  - Groups: group isomorphisms
  - Rings: ring isomorphisms
  - Vector spaces: vector space isomorphisms
  - Topological spaces: homeomorphisms

Category theory provides a general way to think about all of these classes of objects at once. It is extremely useful in algebraic geometry and algebraic topology, and a few applications have been found outside of math, as we will see later in the course.

== Basic Definitions

#definition(title: "category")[#emph[
  A category $C = (O, M, of)$, where $O$ is a collection of "objects," $M$ is a collection of "morphisms" between objects, and $of$ is an operator that "composes" two morphisms. These must satisfy the following properties:
  - Each morphism $f in M$ is assigned to a "domain" object $dom(f) in O$ and a "codomain" object $cod(f) in O$. If $dom(f) = A$ and $cod(f) = B$, we write $f : A -> B$.
  - If $f : A -> B$ and $g : B -> C$, then the composition operator produces a morphism $g of f : A -> C$.
  - (Identity) For each object $A in O$, there is an identity morphism $1_A : A -> A$ which acts like an identity for the composition operator:
    - if $f : A -> B$ then $f of 1_A = f$,
    - if $g : B -> A$ then $1_A of g = g$.
  - (Associativity) If $f : A -> B$, $g : B -> C$, and $h : C -> D$, then $(h of g) of f = h of (g of f)$.
]]

#example[
  The following are examples of categories:
  - $Set$
  - $Grp$
  - $Ring$
  - $K"-"#h(-0.1em)Vect$, for a field $K$
  - $Top$
  - $NN$, where there is a unique morphism $a -> b$ when $a < b$
  - $Trivial$
  - $G$, for any group $G$, with one object
]

*TODO: WRITE MORE ABOUT THESE CATEGORIES*

== Isomorphism

How can we generalize the idea of two sets, groups, etc. being isomorphic? Ideally we would define a notion of isomorphism between pairs of objects in a category $C$. This means that we need to state isomorphism purely in terms of the morphisms between sets, groups, etc., ignoring their set-theoretic elements. This can be done using inverse maps.

#definition(title: "isomorphism")[#emph[
  Two objects $A$ and $B$ in the object set of a category $C$ are isomorphic if there are morphisms $f : A -> B$ and $g : B -> A$ such that $f of g = 1_B$ and $g of f = 1_A$.
]]

This is the first example of a recurring trend: we will try to state many important properties of objects like sets, groups, rings, etc. using purely functions and function composition, while ignoring elements.

== Universal Constructions

*TODO: write out the formal definition of a product* (for now, just look at Wikipedia if you want to see it)

- Products

#image("images/product.png")

- Coproducts (duality)
- Initial objects and terminal objects
  - Initial: for every $X$ there is a unique morphism $I -> X$
- Equalizer (kernel of difference)

#image("images/equalizer.png")

- Tensor products (groups, rings, and vector spaces)

#image("images/tensor_product.png")

All of these constructions are unique up to isomorphism. This can be proved by noting that if we have two objects $P_1$ and $P_2$ which are both products, we have a morphism $P_1 -> P_2$ since $P_1$ maps into $X_1$ and $X_2$, but we also have a morphism $P_2 -> P_1$ since $P_2$ maps into $X_1$ and $X_2$, and the diagram commutes. Since these morphisms are the unique morphisms making this diagram commute, $P_1$ and $P_2$ are isomorphic. TODO expand this paragraph

== Functors

All of the objects (groups, rings, etc.) we were considering above have some kind of structure on top of a set. But you may have noticed that categories also have such a structure: they are a set of objects and a set of morphisms with the additional structure of the composition operator. So is there a notion of structure-preserving functions between categories? Yes, and it is called a functor.

#definition(title: "functor")[#emph[
  A functor from a category $C = (O, M, of)$ to a category $C' = (O', M', of')$ is a pair $(F_O, F_M)$, where $F_O : O -> O'$ and $F_M : M -> M'$, such that:
  - If $f in M$ then $dom(F_M (f)) = F_O (dom(f))$ and $cod(F_M (f)) = F_O (cod(f))$.
  - If $A in O$ then $F_M (1_A) = 1'_(F_O (A))$, where $1'$ denotes an identity morphism for an object in $C'$.
  - If $f, g in M$ such that $f of g$ is defined, then $F_M (f of g) = F_M (f) of' F_M (g)$.
]]

We can now consider categories themselves as objects and functors as morphisms between these objects, allowing us to define the category of categories, $Cat$.

*TODO: discuss duality and natural transformations*

== Exercises

All of the exercises require answering with a proof for a fully complete answer.

- Do all categories have at least one product?
- Do all pairs of objects in $Set$ have a coproduct? If so, what is it?
  - What about in $Grp$?
  - What about in $K"-"#h(-0.1em)Vect$?
  - What about in $NN$? What about in the opposite category of $NN$?
- Is $K"-"#h(-0.1em)Vect$ isomorphic (as an object of $Cat$) to its opposite category?

== The Yoneda Lemma

#image("images/yoneda.png")

This generalizes Cayley's theorem from group theory! TODO explain
