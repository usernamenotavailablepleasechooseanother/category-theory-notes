## Lean, the category!

Objects: Types
Morphisms: Total functions

In Lean, all functions are defined on all inputs and always terminate (unless we tag them as `partial` or `unsafe`). Haskell doesn't have this nice guarentee.

Let's check that Lean is actually a category.

Tip: You can Ctrl-click on anything to see its definition.
-/

-- Composition of morphisms is just function composition, denoted `∘`
#check Function.comp

-- Identity morphism
#check Id
-- `Id` works for all types, whereas `id` is different and works for all terms.

-- Composition of morphisms is associative
#check Function.comp_assoc

-- Equality of morphisms
#check funext
-- If two functions return the same values for every input, then they're equal. This ignores time complexity though so in practice the two functions might not be interchangeable.

## Bicartesian closed categories

Lean is a bicartesian closed category, which means it has an initial object, terminal object, sums, products, exponentials, sums distribute over products, and products distribute over exponentials.
-/

-- Initial object
#check False
-- Morphism from initial object
#check False.elim
-- The logic interpretation of this is that we can prove anything from `False`
-- Isomorphic to initial object but in higher universes, because Lean universes are not cumulative
#check PEmpty
#check PEmpty.elim

-- Terminal object
#check True
-- Morphism to terminal object
#check fun _ ↦ True.intro
-- Also isomorphic
#check PUnit
#check fun _ ↦ PUnit.unit

-- Sums (coproducts), which correspond to `∨` in logic
#check Sum
-- Morphism from first type
#check Sum.inl
-- Morphism from second type
#check Sum.inr
#html sumDiag

-- Products, which correspond to `∧` in logic
#check Prod
-- Morphism to first type
#check Prod.fst
-- Morphism to second type
#check Prod.snd
#html prodDiag

-- Exponentials
#check (· → ·)
-- Lean is self-enriched because we can view any hom-set between `α` and `β` as the object `α → β`.

/-- Sums distribute over products -/

## Universes

You might have noticed the `Type u` in some of those previous examples. In Lean, `2 : ℕ : Type : Type 1 : Type 2 : Type 3`, and so on, where each level of the hierarchy is called a universe. However, if we had `Type : Type`, then that would cause Girard's paradox (a variant of Russell's paradox).

We can't actually assign `Type` a different type using an axiom, but we can add a bad axiom that says there's an injective function from a sigma (dependent product) type in `Type 1` to some type in `Type`. (Thanks to Aaron Liu and Paul Reichert on the Lean Zulip for this proof.)

private theorem false : False :=

## Functors

Recall that a functor is a function from one category to another. An endofunctor is a functor from a category to itself. The type class `[LawfulFunctor F]` corresponds to endofunctors in Lean.

`F` maps objects (it's a type constructor)
`Functor.map (f := F)` (denoted `<$>`) maps morphisms

Note the the `<$>`'s type signature, `(α → β) → f α → f β` is the same thing as `(α → β) → (f α → f β)` because of partial application.

## Contravariant functors

If `(α → ·)` is a functor, then what about `(· → α)`? If you try defining `<$>` for `(· → α)`, you'll find out that it doesn't work, because `(· → α)` is actually a contravariant functor.

Normal functors, sometimes called covariant functors, map Lean to Lean. Contravariant functors map Colean to Lean. They're occasionally called "cofunctors", but that's a misnomer because functors are self-dual.
-/

public class Contrafunctor (F : Type u → Type v) where
  contramap : (β → α) → F α → F β
  -- `contramap` preserves `id`
  id_contramap (x : F α) : contramap id x = x
  -- `contramap` preserves function composition
  comp_contramap (g : β → α) (h : γ → β) (x : F α) : contramap (g ∘ h) x = contramap h (contramap g x)

/-- This is not standard notation but just something I made up -/
infixr:100 " <¥> " => Contrafunctor.contramap

-- Intuitively, `<$>` turns a "producer of α" into a "producer of β" while `<¥>` turns a "consumer of α" into a "consumer of β".

/-- Some useful lemmas -/
lemma Contrafunctor.id_contramap' [Contrafunctor f] : Contrafunctor.contramap (F := f) (@id α) = id := by
  ext x
  exact Contrafunctor.id_contramap x

lemma Contrafunctor.contramap_comp_contramap [Contrafunctor F] (g : α → β) (h : β → γ) :
    ((g <¥> ·) ∘ (h <¥> ·) : F γ → F α) = Contrafunctor.contramap (h ∘ g) :=
  funext fun _ ↦ (comp_contramap _ _ _).symm

/-- The other kind of hom-functor is contravariant -/
@[simp]
instance (α : Type u) : Contrafunctor (· → α) where
  contramap f g := g ∘ f
  id_contramap := by simp
  comp_contramap := by simp [Function.comp_assoc]

/-
Contravariant functors are rarely used in Lean, and most examples of them are function object things like the hom-functor.

A function type is covariant if the free parameter is in an even depth and contravariant if at an odd depth.

- `(α → ·)` is covariant
- `(· → α)` is contravariant
- `((· → α) → β)` is covariant
- `(((· → α) → β) → γ)` is contravariant
- And so on

## Composition of functors

Since functors map Lean to Lean, we can compose two functors to get a new functor. For the object map, we simply compose the object maps of the two functors. To map a morphism `f`, we use the outer functor's `<$>` to map `f` over the inner functor.

## Natural transformations

A natural transformation is a function between two functors that satisfies a naturality condition. Intuitively, a natural transformation "moves" data from one "container" to another.

  naturality (f : α → β) (x : F α) : f <$> (η x) = η (f <$> x)

#html natTransDiag

-- In Haskell, naturality is automatically guarenteed because all polymorphic functions in Haskell are parametrically polymorphic functions, which intuitively means that the function does "the same thing" for every type. This is classic example of "theorems for free". However, in Lean we're not so lucky, because a polymorphic function in Lean can do something different depending on its input type.

## The Yoneda lemma (optional)

"In his Algebraic Geometry class a few years back, Ravi Vakil explained Yoneda's lemma like this: You work at a particle accelerator. You want to understand some particle. All you can do are throw other particles at it and see what happens. If you understand how your mystery particle responds to all possible test particles at all possible test energies, then you know everything there is to know about your mystery particle." (from https://mathoverflow.net/questions/3184/philosophical-meaning-of-the-yoneda-lemma)

To motivate the Yoneda lemma in Lean, let's say we're trying to come up with a natural transformation from the hom-functor `(α → ·)` to an arbitrary functor `F`. This is a function from `α → β` to `F β`.
-/

Yoneda reverse map

If we had some value `x : F α`, then we could get a value of type `F β` using `g <$> x`
-/
def yoneda' [Functor F] [LawfulFunctor F] (x : F α) : NaturalType (α → ·) F :=
  (· <$> x)

/-- The reverse map always produces a natural transformation -/
instance [Functor F] [LawfulFunctor F] : Natural (α → ·) F (yoneda' y) :=
  ⟨fun f x ↦ by simp [yoneda']; rfl⟩

/--
Yoneda forward map (`η` is not necessarily natural)

If we have some natural transformation `η`, was it produced by some `x : F α`? We can specialize `η` to type `α` so that it has type signature `(α → α) → F α`. Then by feeding it `id`, we get some value of type `F α`!
-/
def yoneda (η : NaturalType (α → ·) F) [Functor F] [LawfulFunctor F] : F α :=
  η id

/--
Mapping and unmapping a natural transformation returns itself!

If we start with some `η`, then extracting out that `x : F α` and using it to construct a natural transformation gives us `η` again. Note that this doesn't work for an arbitrary function between the hom-functor and `F` because we use the naturality condition.
-/

/-
Intuitively, using some `x : F α`, we can determine what `η` does when specialized to type `α`, and the behavior of `η` on other types is fully determined because it's parametrically polymorphic.

There's a very similar theorem for contravariant functors.

## Applicative functors and monads

Lean is a purely functional programming language, so functions must only depend on their arguments and have no access to the outside world. Then how can we do IO or have mutable state? The solution is to encode a function's side effects into the return type of the function.

- Functors let us apply `α → β` to `F α`
- Applicatives let us apply `F (a → β)` to `F α`
- But what about applying an effectful function `α → F β` to `F α`, or composing two effectful functions `α → F β` and `β → F γ`?

Solution: `>>=`, which enables us to "shove" a `F α` into a function `α → F β`.

/-
Kleisli category: A monad `m` creates a category where the objects are still types but the morphisms are `α → β` for every `α → F β` in Lean. Then composition of effectful functions becomes composition of morphisms. This construction also motivates the monad laws.

In fact, using `>>=` and `pure` we can implement `<$>` and `<*>` so every monad is also a functor and applicative.

Exercise: Find an example of a functor which is not applicative and an applicative which is not a monad.

This function looks ugly, but we can simplify it with `do` notation, which is syntactic sugar that lets us unwrap monadic values and automatically inserts `>>=` when we use the unwrapped values

Even the identity monad is powerful! We can write code with locally mutable variables, for loops, breaks, and early returns and it gets automatically desugared into nice, purely functional code.

Sadly, in general monads do not compose 😿, but in some cases we can use monad transformers to compose them.

## Monoidal categories

We're now ready to explain the meme quote "A monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors".

So what's the category of endofunctors in Lean?

Objects: `LawfulFunctor`s
Morphisms: Natural transformations

We can compose morphisms using vertical composition, which we proved earlier produces another natural transformation.
-/

/-- Every object has an identity morphism -/
instance [Functor F] [LawfulFunctor F] : Natural F F id :=
  ⟨by simp⟩

/-- Vertical composition is associative -/
lemma nat_trans_comp_assoc (η : NaturalType f g) (μ : NaturalType g h) (ν : NaturalType h i) [Functor f] [LawfulFunctor f] [Functor g] [LawfulFunctor g] [Functor h] [LawfulFunctor h] [Functor i] [LawfulFunctor i] :
    ((ν ∘ μ) ∘ η) x = (ν ∘ μ ∘ η) x := by
  simp only [Function.comp_assoc]

A monoidal category is a category C equipped with a bifunctor ⨂ (called the tensor product) from C × C to C and an identity object I such that ⨂ is associative up to isomorphism, I is an identity with respect to ⨂ up to isomorphism, and some scary diagrams called the coherence conditions commute.

For the category of Lean endofunctors, let ⨂ be functor composition and I be the identity functor `Id`.
-/

/-- ⨂ is obviously associative -/
lemma functor_comp_assoc [Functor F] [LawfulFunctor F] [Functor G] [LawfulFunctor G] [Functor H] [LawfulFunctor H] : (F ∘ G) ∘ H = F ∘ G ∘ H := by
  apply Function.comp_assoc

/-- `Id` is an identity for ⨂ -/
lemma functor_left_id [Functor F] [LawfulFunctor F] : id ∘ F = F := by
  simp

/-- `Id` is an identity for ⨂ -/
lemma functor_right_id [Functor F] [LawfulFunctor F] : F ∘ id = F := by
  simp

-- In the category of Lean endofunctors, these properties are satisfied with equalities, not just up to isomorphism, so the coherence conditions (insert scary pentagon diagram here) are automatically satisfied, phew.

A monoidal object is an object M in (C, ⨂, I) with an arrow μ from M ⨂ M to M and η from I to M such that μ is associative and η is an identity with respect to μ.

A monoidal object in the category of Lean endofunctors is a functor with natural transformations `join` (corresponding to μ) and `pure` (η) with the following properties:
-/

class EndofunctorMonoid M extends Functor M, LawfulFunctor M where
  -- Has type signature `M (M α) → α`
  join : NaturalType (M ∘ M) M
  -- Has type signature `α → M α`
  pure : NaturalType Id M

  Adding another `M` layer with `pure` and then removing it with `join` does nothing:
     M α
    /   \
  M (M α)
  \   /
   M α
  -/
  join_pure : (join ∘ pure) x = x
  /-
  Adding another `M` layer on the inside with `pure` and then removing the outer layer with `join` does nothing:
    M α
     / \
  M (M α)
   \   /
    M α
  (When using <$>, Lean synthesizes the wrong type class instance here for some weird reason)
  -/
  join_map_pure : (join ∘ (map pure ·)) x = x
  /-
  Removing the inner `M` layer and then the outer layer is the same as removing the outer layer and then the inner layer:
  M (M (M α))  M (M (M α))

    M (M α)  =  M (M α)

-- Wait, not so fast! There's a subtle problem: universes. In Lean, monads can be from `Type u → Type v`, while monoids have to be from `Type u → Type u` in order to compose the monoid with itself. If `u > v`, then we can instead define

## Category theory in Lean

Unlike Haskell, Lean is powerful enough that we can also use it for doing category theory in any category, not just the category Lean.
